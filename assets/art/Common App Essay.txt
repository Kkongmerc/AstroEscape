The best way to make a packet of Shin ramen is to boil the noodles for three minutes. Put the seasoning packets in an empty bowl and pour the sizzling hot starchy water on top of it. Stir until you see the dark red aromatic soup and then transfer the noodles into the bowl. Top it off with a crispy-sided fried egg and cut it with your chopsticks so the runny yolk coats the noodles with a soft yellow finish. After you have eaten all the ramen, put some leftover rice from the fridge in the soup, grab a spoonful of it, and crown the bite with a sour cold piece of kimchi. Spicy instant noodles have been my favorite thing to eat for as long as I can remember. It’s not the most luxurious, healthy, or tasty meal to have, but no matter how many times I have it I never get sick of it.
